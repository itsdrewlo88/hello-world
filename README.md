# hello-world
1st interaction with repository.
I am almost 31 and have always been looking for something i could fall in love with as a hobby as well as make a living from while growing and contributing within its community. I feel I have finally found what i was looking for! Coding is the most addictive interesting yet understandably important system and community that is literally running every aspect of the modern world in the background while the rest of the world enjoys all the benifits yet somehow sees none of the effort this amazing group of people contribute.
